This C program performs a basic arithmetic operation, like adding two numbers. The code starts by including the standard input-output header file (#include <stdio.h>). Then, it defines the main function, which is the entry point of the program.

Inside the main function, the code declares two integer variables, say a and b, to store the numbers we want to add, and another integer sum to store the result. The program then assigns values to a and b, adds them together, and stores the result in sum.

Finally, the program prints the result using printf, and the return 0; statement indicates that the program has finished successfully.
